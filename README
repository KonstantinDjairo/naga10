naga10
======

a cute japanese bitmap font found on the internet; all credits to respective authors (see README_JP)

couldn't find this source in the AUR so here i am compiling it by myself...

comes with diffs for maru10.bdf and min10.bdf, so if you have those you can throw them in too.

requires: bdftopcf
