naga10
======

a cute japanese bitmap font found on the internet; all credits to respective authors (see README_JP)

comes with diffs for maru10.bdf and min10.bdf, so if you have those you can throw them in too - they're not free though

fontconfig won't recognize this font, so you'll have to check if it's installed via xlsfonts

optional alias.sh script to alias the long unreadable font name to naga10/naga10b. provides a backup of course, but still somewhat hacky.
if not installing via AUR, might as well put them in your own folder and provide your own fonts.alias (or even better, just xset fp the out/ directory)

requires: bdftopcf

now on the AUR - bdf-naga10-git
